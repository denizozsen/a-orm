# den-orm

A simple ORM library with the following features:

* Supports both PDO and Mysqli
* Implements the ActiveRecord pattern
* Coming soon: Repository pattern
* Coming soon: possibility to cut out persistence functionality from model classes and work with POPOs
* Very good code completion support (when using an IDE that parses PhpDoc annotations)
* Fluent syntax
* No external dependencies
