# a-orm

Another ORM Library for PHP

## Features
* Supports both PDO and Mysqli
* Implements the ActiveRecord pattern
* Coming soon: Repository pattern (possibility to cut out persistence functionality from model classes and work with POPOs)
* Very good code completion support (when using an IDE that parses PhpDoc annotations)
* Fluent syntax
* No external dependencies
* Supports PHP versions 5.6 and up

## Installation
a-orm is in the early development stage, so you have to install the dev version.

```bash
$ composer require denizozsen/a-orm:@dev
```
